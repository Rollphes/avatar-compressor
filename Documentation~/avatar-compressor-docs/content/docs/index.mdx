description: VRChat avatar compression utility
---

Avatar Compressor is a utility for creating lightweight VRChat avatars that more players can see. It analyzes your avatar's assets and applies compression based on complexity at build time, keeping your original files untouched.

## Features

<Cards>
  <Card title="Non-Destructive (NDMF)">
    Powered by NDMF, compression is applied only during the build process. Your
    original assets are never modified, so you can freely adjust settings
    anytime.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Complexity-based Analysis">
    Automatically determines optimal compression for each texture based on
    complexity analysis. Detailed textures are preserved while simple ones are
    compressed.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Tool Compatibility">
    Works with Modular Avatar and Avatar Optimizer. Runs before these tools in
    the build pipeline to ensure compatibility.
