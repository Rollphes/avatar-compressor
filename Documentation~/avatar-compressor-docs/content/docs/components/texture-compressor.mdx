title: Texture Compressor
description: Complexity-based texture compression component
---

Texture Compressor analyzes avatar textures and compresses them based on their complexity. Complex textures (detailed patterns, text) receive less compression, while simple textures (solid colors, gradients) receive more compression.

</div>

## Usage

<Steps>
<Step>
### Add the Component

1. Select your avatar's root GameObject (the one with the VRC Avatar Descriptor)
2. In the Inspector, click **Add Component**
3. Navigate to **Avatar Compressor > LAC Texture Compressor**, or search for "Texture Compressor"

</Step>
<Step>

### Select a Preset

Choose a preset that matches your needs.

<Callout type="info">
**Balanced** is recommended for most avatars.
</Callout>
</Step>
<Step>
### Build Your Avatar

Build your avatar normally through VRChat SDK. The component automatically:

1. Analyzes all textures in your avatar
2. Calculates compression level for each texture based on complexity
3. Creates compressed copies (originals remain untouched)
4. Updates materials to use compressed textures

</Step>
</Steps>

## Presets

<Tabs items={['HighQuality', 'Quality', 'Balanced', 'Aggressive', 'Maximum', 'Custom']}>
<Tab value="HighQuality">
**Minimal compression for showcase avatars.**

| Setting          | Value          |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Divisor Range    | 1x - 2x        |
| Resolution Range | 256px - 2048px |

Best for avatars where visual quality is the top priority.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Quality">
**Prioritizes visual quality while allowing moderate compression.**

| Setting          | Value          |
| ---------------- | -------------- |
| Divisor Range    | 1x - 4x        |
| Resolution Range | 128px - 2048px |

</Tab>
<Tab value="Balanced">
**Good balance between quality and file size. (Recommended)**

| Setting          | Value         |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Divisor Range    | 1x - 8x       |
| Resolution Range | 64px - 2048px |

Recommended for most avatars. Provides significant file size reduction while maintaining good visual quality.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Aggressive">
**Strong compression for Quest avatars or limited VRAM.**

| Setting          | Value         |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Divisor Range    | 2x - 8x       |
| Resolution Range | 32px - 2048px |

Use this for Quest avatars or when you need to significantly reduce VRAM usage.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Maximum">
**Maximum file size reduction.**

| Setting          | Value         |
| ---------------- | ------------- |
| Divisor Range    | 2x - 16x      |
| Resolution Range | 32px - 2048px |

<Callout type="warn">This preset may noticeably affect visual quality.</Callout>

Use this when file size is critical.

</Tab>
<Tab value="Custom">
**Full control over all settings.**

When you select Custom, all settings become editable. See [Advanced Settings](#advanced-settings) below.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Texture Filters

Control which texture types are processed:

| Filter                     | Description                                          |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **Process Main Textures**  | Color/albedo textures (`_MainTex`, `_BaseMap`, etc.) |
| **Process Normal Maps**    | Normal/bump maps (`_BumpMap`, `_NormalMap`, etc.)    |
| **Process Emission Maps**  | Emission textures (`_EmissionMap`, etc.)             |
| **Process Other Textures** | Metallic, roughness, and other textures              |

### Size Filters

| Filter                   | Description                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Min Source Size**      | Only process textures larger than this size (in pixels)      |
| **Skip If Smaller Than** | Skip textures smaller than or equal to this size (in pixels) |

<Callout type="info">
  These two filters work together. For example, with Min Source Size = 256 and
  Skip If Smaller Than = 128, textures smaller than 256px are excluded from
  processing, and textures at or below 128px are completely skipped.
</Callout>

## Preview

Click **Preview Compression Results** in the Inspector to see compression analysis before building.

### Summary

The preview shows total size statistics:

| Metric       | Description                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Original** | Total uncompressed size of all textures |
| **After**    | Estimated size after compression        |
| **Savings**  | Percentage and bytes saved              |

### Texture List

For each texture, the preview displays:

- **Texture name and type** (Main, Normal, Emission, Other)
- **Complexity score** (0.0 - 1.0) with visual progress bar
- **Size change** - Original resolution → Recommended resolution (with divisor)

### Complexity Score Interpretation

| Score     | Level     | Compression               |
| --------- | --------- | ------------------------- |
| < 0.2     | Very Low  | Heavy compression applied |
| 0.2 - 0.4 | Low       | Suitable for compression  |
| 0.4 - 0.6 | Medium    | Moderate compression      |
| 0.6 - 0.8 | High      | Light compression only    |
| ≥ 0.8     | Very High | Minimal compression       |

### Skipped Textures

Textures that won't be processed are shown separately with skip reasons:

- **Too small**: Texture is smaller than the minimum size threshold
- **Filtered by type**: Texture type is disabled in filters

<Callout type="info">
  The preview does not update automatically. If settings change after generating
  a preview, a warning will appear prompting you to click the button again to
  refresh.

<Accordions>
<Accordion title="Analysis Strategy">
The analysis strategy determines how texture complexity is calculated.

| Strategy         | Description                                                                  | Best For            |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- |
| **Fast**         | Quick analysis using gradient, spatial frequency, and color variance         | Quick builds, Quest |
| **HighAccuracy** | Detailed analysis using DCT and GLCM                                         | Quality-focused     |
| **Perceptual**   | Analysis aligned with human perception using block variance and edge density | General use         |
| **Combined**     | Weighted combination of all strategies                                       | Most accurate       |

When using the **Combined** strategy, you can adjust the weight of each sub-strategy:

| Weight                   | Default | Description                            |
| ------------------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Fast Weight**          | 0.3     | Contribution of Fast strategy          |
| **High Accuracy Weight** | 0.5     | Contribution of High Accuracy strategy |
| **Perceptual Weight**    | 0.2     | Contribution of Perceptual strategy    |

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Complexity Thresholds">
| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **High Complexity Threshold** | Textures above this receive minimal compression |
| **Low Complexity Threshold** | Textures below this receive maximum compression |

Textures between these thresholds receive interpolated compression.

</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Resolution Settings">
| Setting | Description |
| ------- | ----------- |
| **Min Divisor** | Minimum scale factor (1 = no reduction) |
| **Max Divisor** | Maximum scale factor (8 = 1/8 size) |
| **Min Resolution** | Textures won't be scaled below this |
| **Max Resolution** | Textures won't exceed this |
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Special Texture Handling">
- **Normal Maps**: Analyzed using normal vector variation instead of color complexity
- **Emission Maps**: Complexity score is adjusted by 10% for emission-specific handling
- **Sparse Textures**: Textures with many transparent pixels (fewer than 100 opaque pixels) receive a low complexity score for efficient processing
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Power of Two">
- **Force Power of Two**: When enabled (default), output dimensions are forced to powers of 2 (e.g., 256, 512, 1024). This is recommended for optimal GPU memory usage.
</Accordion>
<Accordion title="Debug">
- **Enable Logging**: When enabled (default), compression details are logged to the Unity console during build. Useful for debugging or verifying compression results.
</Accordion>
</Accordions>

## Compatibility

<Callout type="info">
  Texture Compressor runs during the NDMF Transforming phase, before Modular
  Avatar and Avatar Optimizer. This ensures textures are compressed before other
  tools process the avatar.
