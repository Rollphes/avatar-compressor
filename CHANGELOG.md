and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Platform-specific compression formats** - Automatic format selection based on build target
  - Desktop (PC): DXT1, DXT5, BC5 (normal maps), BC7 (high complexity)
  - Mobile (Quest/Android): ASTC 4x4, 6x6, 8x8 based on complexity and alpha
- **High-quality format option** for high complexity textures (BC7/ASTC_4x4)
- **Memory estimation display** in compression preview showing estimated VRAM usage
- **Predicted compression format display** in texture list preview
- **Unit tests** for TextureProcessor and TextureFormatSelector

### Changed

- **Renamed** `TextureResizer` to `TextureProcessor` for better clarity
- **Renamed** `HighQualityComplexityThreshold` to `HighComplexityThreshold` for consistency
- **Refactored** texture format selection into dedicated `TextureFormatSelector` class

### Fixed

- **Build phase** changed from Transforming to Optimizing for proper NDMF pipeline integration
- **Mobile format selection** now properly incorporates alpha channel support
- **ASTC format** alpha support clarified in mobile format selection
- **Unnecessary compression** now skipped for already formatted textures
- **Pixel reading failures** now logged for better debugging
- **ExecuteAlways attribute removed** from TextureCompressor to prevent unintended execution in edit mode
- **Auto-referencing disabled** in asmdef files to avoid unnecessary dependencies

## [0.1.0] - 2026-01-03

### Added

- Initial release of Avatar Compressor (LAC - Limitex Avatar Compressor)
- **Texture Compressor** with complexity-based compression
  - Multiple analysis strategies: Fast, HighAccuracy, Perceptual, and Combined
  - 5 built-in presets: HighQuality, Quality, Balanced, Aggressive, Maximum
  - Custom configuration mode for fine-tuned control
  - Texture type awareness with specialized handling for normal maps and emission maps
  - Shared texture optimization (textures used by multiple materials are processed once)
- Editor UI with real-time compression preview
- NDMF integration for non-destructive avatar builds
- Runs before Avatar Optimizer in the build pipeline for optimal results
